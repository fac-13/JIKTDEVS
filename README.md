## Useful features for your concern
- We have ensured our website is accessable to visually impared and blind users, so your website can reach a wider audience.
- We took a mobile first approach so the website is easily viewable on mobile phones, tablets and desktops.
-  We have used a navigation bar so you can quickly move the sections of our website.

##Process

****28.02.18****

1. We created a wireframe layout of our website collaboratively and by using online tools (designer.gravit.io). We decided on a mobile first approach to ensure our website is responsive and for easy navigation.

2. We created our repo on GitHub and added a HTML and CSS file.

3. We divided the tasks between two pairs HTML and CSS. With the wireframe the HTML pair started creating the skeleton. The CSS pair created a apt layout to be added to the HMTL file.

4. The HTML repo was uploaded to GitHub, the CSS pair started adding style to the code.
